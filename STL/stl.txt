Sequence containers are used for data structures that store objects of the same type in a linear manner.

Container:
A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented
 as class templates(imp), which allows great flexibility in the types supported as elements. 
The container manages the storage space for its elements and provides member functions to access them, 
either directly or through iterators (reference objects with similar properties to pointers)




The STL SequenceContainer types are:
--------------------------------------

1>array represents a static contiguous array,(class template)
2>vector represents a dynamic contiguous array ,support random access ,push_back() ,(class template)
3>forward_list represents a singly-linked list
4>list represents a doubly-linked list
5>deque represents a double-ended queue, where elements can be added to the front or back of the queue

Associative containers provide sorted data structures that provide a fast lookup (O(log n) time) using keys.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The STL AssociativeContainer types are can be divided in two ways: containers 
which require unique keys, and those which allow multiple entries using the same key.

Keys are unique
set is a collection of unique keys, sorted by keys
map is a collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys
set and map are typically implemented using red-black trees
Multiple entries for the same key are permitted
multiset is a collection of keys, sorted by keys
multimap is a collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys


Unordered Associative Containers
Unordered associative containers provide unsorted data structures that can be accessed using a hash. Access times are
 O(n) in the worst-case, but much faster than linear time for most operations.

For all STL UnorderedAssociativeContainer types, a hashed key is used to access the data. Similar to the AssociativeContainer, the standard types are split between those that require unique keys, and those that do not:

Keys are unique
unordered set is a collection of keys, hashed by keys
unordered_map is a collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys
Multiple entires for the same key are permitted
unordered_multiset is a collection of keys, hashed by keys
unordered_multimap is a collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys

The standard container adapters are:
---------------------------------------
stack provides an LIFO data structure
queue provides a FIFO data structure
priority_queue provides a priority queue, which allows for constant-time lookup of the largest element (by default)
