A copy constructor must leave the source object intact, so it must allocate 
its own copy of the object's data for itself. Both objects now refer to different 
copies of the same data in different areas of memory 


A move constructor, on the other hand, can simply "move" the data by 
taking ownership of the pointer that refers to the data, leaving the data
 itself where it resides. The new object now points at the original data, and
 the source object is modified to no longer point at the data. The data itself is 
left untouched.


A move constructor allows the resources owned by an rvalue object to be moved into an lvalue without creating its copy. An rvalue is an 
expression that does not have  any memory address, and an lvalue is an expression with a memory address.

int &j = 20;
The above code snippet will give an error because, in C++, a variable cannot be referenced to a temporary object. The correct way to do 
it is to create anâ€‹ rvalue reference using && :

int &&j = 20;
Temporary objects are often created during the execution of a C++ program.
